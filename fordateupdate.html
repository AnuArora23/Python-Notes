                    <h1> PREPARE DATA FOR MACHINE LEARNING</h1>

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    When utilizing ML to address real-world issues, data preparation is typically the initial step. This is due to the fact that before a dataset can be used to train machine learning or deep learning algorithms, it usually contains a number of inconsistencies that must be fixed. The following is a list of problems with unprepared data:
  </p>
<ul><li>Missing Values in the Dataset</li>
<li>Different File Formats</li>
<li>Outlying Data Points</li>
<li>Inconsistency in variable values</li>
<li>Irrelevant feature variables.</li></ul>
              
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                   STEPS INVOLVED IN DATA PREPARATION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
<ol><li>
Gather data: <br>

Finding the appropriate data is the first step in the data preparation process. This might originate from a database that already exists or could be added on the fly.

</li><li>Discover and assess data<br>

Discovering each dataset is crucial after data collection. Understanding the data and what has to be done before the data is relevant in a given context are the goals of this step.
</li><li>
Cleanse and validate data<br>

Though generally, the most time-consuming step in the data preparation process, cleaning up the data is essential for eliminating inaccurate data and filling in any gaps. Here, crucial duties include:
<br>
Eliminating irrelevant information and outliers, Adding values when there are gaps Data standardization, data masking, and sensitive or private data entry
</li><li>Transform and enrich data<br>

Data transformation involves changing the format or value entries to achieve a specific result or to make the data more comprehensible to a larger audience. Adding to and connecting data with additional relevant information in order to deliver deeper insights is referred to as enriching data.

</li><li> Store data<br>

When the data is ready, it can be saved or sent to a third-party program, like a business intelligence tool, opening the door for processing and analysis.
